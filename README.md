# CountryGuru

Chat-like iOS app and terminal CLI that answer country-related questions using a modular core library.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Swift (async/await)
- **UI**: SwiftUI (iOS app)
- **Networking**: `URLSession` via `URLSessionHTTPClient`
- **Core Module**: `CountryGuruCore` (domain, composition, networking)
- **AI Interpreter**: OpenAI Chat Completions API driven by `OpenAIInterpreter`
- **Tests**: Unit + Integration (including OpenAI API integration tests)

## What the iOS App Does

- Presents a chat UI where you can ask country-related questions
- Classifies your question with `OpenAIInterpreter` into a supported inquiry type
- Loads the answer from data sources (e.g., Rest Countries API) via the core module
- Shows answers as text, images (flags), or lists, with loading and retry states

## What the CLI App Does

- Accepts a question from the terminal and prints the answer
- Uses the same `CountryGuruCore` composition as the iOS app

## Supported Inquiries (examples)

- What is the capital of [Country]?
- What is the flag of [Country]?
- What countries start with [letters]?
- What is the ISO alpha-2 country code for [Country]?

The app uses OpenAI (via `OpenAIInterpreter`) to understand free-form natural language and classify it into one of the supported inquiry categories, also extracting the relevant domain (e.g., the country name or prefix).

## Architecture Overview

## Repository Structure

- `CountryGuruCore/`: Core framework shared by iOS and CLI
  - `Domain/`: Inquiry models, interpreter protocols, `OpenAIInterpreter`
  - `Network/`: `HTTPClient` protocol, `URLSessionHTTPClient`, loaders
  - `Main/`: App composition (`CountryGuruComposer`)
- `CountryGuru/`: iOS app (SwiftUI views + view models)
- `CountryGuruCLI/`: CLI tool using the same core
- `CountryGuruCoreTests/`, `CountryGuruCoreIntegrationTests/`: Tests

### Core Abstractions (CountryGuruCore)

- **`Inquiry` protocol**: Represents a specific question type. Each inquiry knows how to build its request and map a network response to a `QueryResponse`.
- **`InquiryType` enum**: Enumerates supported inquiries and provides prompt examples used by the AI with `promptExample`.
- **`AnyInquiry`**: Type-erased wrapper holding the `InquiryType` and an `InquiryCreator` closure to produce concrete `Inquiry` instances from a domain string.
- **`InquiryInterpreter` protocol`**: Translates a raw user question into a concrete `Inquiry`. Implemented by `OpenAIInterpreter`.
- **`OpenAIInterpreter`**: Calls the OpenAI Chat API with a compact prompt, returning the chosen `InquiryType` and extracted domain (e.g., country name or prefix). The prompt includes:
  - A dynamic list of supported classifications derived from injected inquiries
  - Examples sourced from `InquiryType.promptExample`
  - A strict JSON-only response format
- **`HTTPClient` protocol`**: Abstraction over GET/POST requests with error mapping via `HTTPClientError`.
- **`URLSessionHTTPClient`**: Concrete implementation using `URLSession` with centralized error mapping.
- **`RemoteInquiryLoader`**: Executes the request produced by an `Inquiry` and maps the result to a `QueryResponse`.
- **`CountryGuruComposer`**: Wires everything together (inquiries, interpreter, loader, http client) and exposes reusable factory methods for apps.

### iOS App (SwiftUI)

- **View Models**: Drive the UI state machine (`processing`, `success`, `error`, `notSupported`)
- **Views**: Present chat bubbles, images, loading and retry states, and an input bar following Appleâ€™s HIG
- **Flow**:
  1. User types a question and submits
  2. `OpenAIInterpreter` classifies and extracts the domain
  3. Core creates the matching `Inquiry` via `AnyInquiry.inquiryCreator`
  4. `RemoteInquiryLoader` fetches data and returns a `QueryResponse`
  5. View updates accordingly (text, image, list, error, or not supported)

### CLI

- Composed with the same `CountryGuruComposer`
- Reads a line from stdin, resolves the inquiry and prints the response

## Error Handling

- Errors from networking are mapped to `HTTPClientError` (e.g., `timeout`, `notFound`, `invalidRequest`, `serverError`, `other`)
- The interpreter throws `InquiryInterpreterError.notSupported` for unrecognized questions or malformed AI responses
- UI shows retry affordances and helpful messages

## Prompts and Token Efficiency

- System prompt is compact and deterministic
- Classifications are injected from the active `inquiries` (no unused labels)
- Examples come from `InquiryType.promptExample` to guide the model while minimizing tokens
- Response must be strict JSON: `{ "type": "...", "domain": "..." }`

## Setup & Run

### Requirements

- Xcode 15+ (Swift 5.9+)
- iOS 17+ (target can be adjusted if needed)

### iOS App

1. Open `CountryGuru.xcworkspace` in Xcode
2. Select the `CountryGuru` scheme
3. Run on a simulator or device

### CLI

1. Open `CountryGuruCLI/CountryGuruCLI.xcodeproj`
2. Select the `CountryGuruCLI` scheme
3. Run (or `swift run` if you create a SwiftPM target in the future)

### OpenAI API Key

- The core uses an API key provided by `CountryGuruComposer` for the `OpenAIInterpreter`
- For production, prefer loading from environment or the Keychain and avoid committing secrets

## Testing

- Unit tests for networking, inquiries, and composition in `CountryGuruCoreTests`
- Integration tests in `CountryGuruCoreIntegrationTests` (may hit external APIs). Configure your API key and network permissions accordingly

## Privacy & Networking

- External calls: OpenAI Chat Completions API and `restcountries.com`
- No analytics or tracking built-in
- Consider showing a privacy notice if shipping to App Store

## Contributing

- Issues and PRs welcome. Please include tests and follow the existing code style (clarity, explicit naming, early returns, minimal comments).

If you have questions about extending the set of inquiries or swapping interpreters (e.g., CoreML), see `InquiryType`, `InquiryInterpreter`, and `CountryGuruComposer` for integration points.
